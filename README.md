Development is divided into phases.  
The project will eventually be open sourced. However, I will work on the first few phases myself, to maximize learning.  
The following is a list of features I'll be planning to add to it:  
## Phase 1 (Basic Features)
- [x] A simple fixed size canvas to draw on using a black coloured stroke.
- [x] Different shapes like rectangle, ellipse, arrow, line and stroke.
- [x] An eraser to erase the strokes (deleting the strokes).
- [x] Changing colour of strokes
- [x] Smoothing the strokes using different algorithms
- [x] Testing.
