Development is divided into phases.  
The project will eventually be open sourced. However, I will work on the first few phases myself, to maximize learning.  
The following is a list of features I'll be planning to add to it:  
## Phase 1 (Basic Features)
- [ ] A simple fixed size canvas to draw on using a black coloured stroke.
- [ ] An eraser to erase the strokes (using the standard way and deleting the strokes).
- [ ] Resizing the stroke.
- [ ] Changing colour of strokes
- [ ] Smoothing the strokes using different algorithms
- [ ] Testing.
