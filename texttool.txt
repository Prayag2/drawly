Text Tool!
---------
Behaviour
    1. Clicking anywhere would create a text box
    2. Bounding box would not be visible unless selection tool is used
    3. After the text box is created, user can use keyboard to type
    4. Preedit/compose text support should be present
    5. Ability to select text
    6. When entering text, selected text should be deleted
    7. Cursor should have an index in the string
    8. Ability to calculate cursor index from mouse position
    9. Handle special key presses like backspace, arrow keys, modifier keys (e.g., holding shift while moving left should select text, holding control should jump to the next/previous whitespace, holding both should do both the things, etc..)

Implementation
--------------
Tool:
    1. There will be modes for the tool: NORMAL, EDIT.
    2. On mouse press
        1. If clicked inside an existing text box, make it ACTIVE, calculate cursor index from cursor's position, and enter EDIT mode for that text box. Set clicked to true.
        2. Else remove currently active text box from ACTIVE.
    3. On mouse move
        1. If clicked is false, do nothing.
           Else update ending index of selection according to the cursor's x position.
    4. On mouse release
        1. Set clicked to false
    5. On key press
        1. If ACTIVE is not null
            1. Handle modifier keys: CTRL + C -> Copy selection to clipboard
                                     CTRL + X -> Delete selected text and copy it to clipboard
                                     CTRL + V -> Insert clipboard content to cursor index
                                     CTRL + A -> Change selection start and end index to 0 and n-1
                                     CTRL + LEFT ARROW -> Move cursor index to the previous word
                                     CTRL + RIGHT ARROW -> Move cursor index to the next word
                                     SHIFT + LEFT ARROW -> Move end index of the selection box one place to the left
                                     SHIFT + RIGHT ARROW -> Move end index of the selection box one place to the right
                                     CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT ARROW -> Move end index of the selection box to the left by one word
                                     CTRL + SHIFT + RIGHT ARROW -> Move end index of the selection box to the right by one word
                                     CTRL + u -> Clear textbox
                                     CTRL + Backspace OR CTRL + w -> Delete text from current index to the previous word
                                     BACKSPACE -> Delete character before current index
                                     ENTER -> Insert new line character
                                     HOME -> Move current index to 0
                                     END -> Move current index to n-1
                                     DELETE -> Delete character at current index.
            2. If selection is not null, delete selected text. Set selection indices to -1 and update current index accordingly.
            2. Insert character at current index of the string of the ACTIVE text box
